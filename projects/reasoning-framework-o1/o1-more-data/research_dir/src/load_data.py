paper_text = """# Paper: Minimal Implementation of an Open Reasoner Setup

This document outlines a small example pipeline that integrates the four key services (Policy Initialization, Reward Design, Search, and Learning) for an Open Reasoner system.

## 1. Policy Initialization
We begin with a minimal policy. Conceptually, it is derived from "gpt-4o-mini". For demonstration, we simply store a placeholder indicating that we have loaded or fine-tuned a base policy.

## 2. Reward Design
Here we define a trivial pass/fail mechanism for code tasks (if output is correct, reward=1, else 0) or for math tasks (if the final numeric answer matches, reward=1, else 0). Although simplistic, it demonstrates how outcome-based rewards can be plugged in. For step-level feedback, we could check each partial step.

## 3. Search
We show a placeholder "Best-of-N" approach (N=3) that attempts a few code or math solutions, then picks the best (highest reward). Even this basic method can improve correctness by sampling multiple attempts.

## 4. Learning
We provide a placeholder for Behavior Cloning. In practice, we would gather solutions from the search phase, filter to those with reward=1, and fine-tune the policy with them.

## Data Generation
We demonstrate the integration of an external HuggingFace dataset by importing a small excerpt of the GLUE SST-2 data, saved to "research_dir/data/glue_sst2_excerpt.json". We also create minimal code and math tasks stored in "research_dir/data".

## Conclusion
This code structure shows how a minimal pipeline can be formed:
1) Start from an initial policy.
2) Define a simple reward mechanism.
3) Run a tiny search routine for each prompt.
4) Gather data to train or refine the policy further.

All relevant files are placed in "research_dir". This demonstration offers a scaffold for building more complex or domain-specific reasoning frameworks with four distinct services and iterative improvement strategies.
